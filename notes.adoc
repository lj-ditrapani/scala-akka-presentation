Draw our planned stream design?


Cost of typed language
----------------------
- Extra wordiness of types
- Optimized for maintainability/readability over write-ability
- 'noise' of types
- Almost like 2 languages; the runtime semantics & the type system


Benefit
-------
- maintainability
- readability (types are documentation)
- performance (not true with TypeScript)
- Don't need tests to check that you implemented the interface correctly
- Don't need tests to check that you are using the interface correctly
- Debugging tools


FP
--
- Referential transparency
- Immutable data structures
- Pure, side-effect-free functions


== List Data Structure

* ADT product & sum
