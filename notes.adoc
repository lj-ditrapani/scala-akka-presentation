Draw actor diagram (3 actors, mailboxes)
Draw a stream graph with load balancer & multi parallel streams
Draw our planned stream design?


== Cost of statically typed language

* Extra wordiness of types
* Optimized for maintainability/readability over write-ability
* 'noise' of types
* Almost like 2 languages; the runtime semantics & the type system


== Benefit

* maintainability
* readability (types are documentation)
* performance (not true with TypeScript)
* Don't need tests to check that you implemented the interface correctly
* Don't need tests to check that you are using the interface correctly
* Debugging tools
* Expressing developer intent
* Machine checked every TDD cycle: always in-sync


== Functional Programming

* Referential transparency
* Immutable data structures
* Pure, side-effect-free functions
* Easier to reason about code

== Algebraic Data Types

* Work especially well in FP + statically types languages
  * compile time pattern matching type check (exhaustive)
* Common in functional programming languages

== List Data Structure

* ADT product & sum

== Expression Problem

* Scala implementation of case classes & pattern matching
* allow both approaches, although not without re-compilation.
* Type classes (which scala has) actually do solve this problem completely.
